- Converted CSV file to matrix in order to access the data required to create SDC format

DAY THREE
- Processed the clock constraints to openMSP430.sdc file following the SDC format
- Processed the input port constraints to openMSP430.sdc file following the SDC format

DAY FIVE
- Final output is displayed here
